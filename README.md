## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
This project focuses on generating **lip-synced videos** by aligning facial movements with arbitrary speech audio using state-of-the-art deep learning models.  
The implementation is based on the **Wav2Lip** architecture, which ensures precise temporal alignment between audio and video frames without requiring manual annotations.  

The system can be used in:
- Film dubbing automation
- Accessibility tools for the hearing impaired
- Real-time virtual avatars

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, librosa, ffmpeg
- **Model:** Wav2Lip (GAN-based architecture)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, CUDA-enabled GPU

## Features
- Synchronizes lip movements in video with arbitrary speech audio
- Works with any clear frontal-face video
- High visual realism using GAN-based architecture
- Frame-accurate temporal alignment
